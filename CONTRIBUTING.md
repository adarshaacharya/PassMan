# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES

# Contribution Guidelines

- If you're planning to implement a new feature I will recommend you to discuss with me before you start coding so you won't end up working on something that I don't want to implement. Create an Issue with proper name and content for discussion.
- Similarly, for huge bug fix you can create issue and we can discuss about it further.
- Otherwise, for minor things you can go ahead.
- You can email me on [connectwithadarsha@gmail.com](connectwithadarsha@gmail.com) or dm on [@adarsha_ach](https://twitter.com/adarsha_ach) if you need any help understanding the code.
